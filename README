These  programs were originally part of the CHIANTI-VAMDC Interactive Python,
later renamed CHIANTI-IP, and part of CHIANTI Virtual IDL and Python (CHIANTI-VIP) 
software, an extension of the original CHIANTI software.


The original version was written in February 2016
within the UK-VAMDC consortium, with partial  funding (only for three months) by STFC (UK)
 by  Giulio Del Zanna (GDZ, University of Cambridge).


The core functions present here are the same used within a Django application,
also originally written in February 2016, to calculate the
emissivities of spectral lines and perform simple line ratios.

The Django application is available at

https://chianti-vip.com/index.php/line-ratios-interactive/


The Python program emiss_calc.py  is a simple example on how
a user can calculate the emissivities of the lines within an ion
without using the Django application.

In the future, more programs and GUIs will be made available.
